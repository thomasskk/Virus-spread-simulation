# Virus-spread-simulation

Representation of the spread of a virus day by day based approximately on the stats of the covid-19. The population size is 1 000 000 with each pixel representing one person. All the data is stored and updated in a dataframe using pandas. I tried to maximize the performance as much as possible and was able to get 4-5 fps on my setup.

# Installation
